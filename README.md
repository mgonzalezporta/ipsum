## tviz
tviz is an R package that offers several functions to plot gene and transcript expression levels estimated from RNA-seq experiments, combining both sample-specific and summarised approaches.
It was initially intended to be used with [Lorem](https://github.com/mgonzalezporta/lorem) for the identification and visualisation of extreme changes in splicing across conditions, but it can be also executed independently.
